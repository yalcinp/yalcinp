### 👤 Profile Summary

I am a software developer and researcher with an academic background in **Control and Automation Engineering (BSc)** and **Computational Science and Engineering (MSc)**, with a focus on the intersection of **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **high-performance computing**. 

My experience spans industrial R&D environments (e.g., Siemens) as well as research-driven academic projects. I have worked on robotics systems using ROS, developed APIs in C#, and used MATLAB/Simulink and C++ for simulation tools. I have also explored machine learning and different neural network models (such as ANN, CNN, and RNN) for biomedical data analysis.

Currently, I am developing the open-source HDMR library at the Marenostrum supercomputer for large-scale computational frameworks, focusing on tensor decomposition and its applications across various domains, including machine learning, data analysis, and beyond.
